Delivering silky-smooth performance and unmatched support so you can

ScrollTrigger enables anyone to create jaw-dropping scroll-based animations with minimal code. Infinitely flexible. Scrub, pin, snap, or just trigger anything scroll-related, even if it has nothing to do with animation. ScrollTriggers can perform an actions on an animation (play, pause, resume, restart, reverse, complete, reset) when entering/leaving the defined area or link it directly to the scrollbar so that it acts like a scrubber
